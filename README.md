This file is the guidance for running XGboost and multimodal transformer models for predicting PFAS rejections by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes. All the codes were run and tested on Google Colab. Jupyter noteboook or other Python integrated development environments (IDE)/code editor can also be used to run the codes.
